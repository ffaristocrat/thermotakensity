Measure the thermodynamic intensity of opinions on Twitter using the Ingraham scale

---

Twitter is rife with bad opinions or "Hot Takes" as they are currently called. How do we quantify the badness of someone's thoughts? Many people have focused on The Ratio as a way to evaluate the terribleness of someone's tweet. Unfortunately, it is a crude measure that doesn't take into account the reach of an awful post. This makes comparing Ratio'd tweets difficult.

Inspired by the Richter Scale, scientists in the burgeoning field of thermotakeonics have developed a new way to measure & compare these kinds of posts. Named for the fash-curious Fox News host, the Ingraham Scale incorporates likes, retweets and replies into a logarithmic equation.

This chrome extension will highlight and rate takes that exceed 1.0 on the Ingraham Scale.
